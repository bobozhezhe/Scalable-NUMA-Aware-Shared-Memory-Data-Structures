# Weekly Report

This is the log file for weekly job and plans.

## Week 1 (2 Jan, 2023)

### Progress in this week

1. Finish Project Proposal.
2. Learn and understand the common conception of NUMA.

### Question in this week

1. How to set up the environment: ubuntu + clion + gcc +boost?
2. What is the tool to evaluate performance? PMDK, Intel Memory Latency Checker, other?
3. Recommended tools to evaluate shared memory
4. What's the kind of test case?
5. What's test env? Anything we need to install in our dev env?
6. Currently our basic thought is to create several test cases with random numbers of each data structure, in different ways of memory allocation (?是应该这么说吗) and compare their performances

### Plan for next week

1. Build up dev env. (ubuntu + clion + gcc +boost)
2. Write a simple test case for mem test.
3. Prepare test cases for shared mem. (Random data + multi-way access + shared mem)
4. Set up and run the test software to show the perm of Boost.
